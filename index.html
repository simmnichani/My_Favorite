        <p>My Favorite hobby is gymnastics. Gymnastics is a sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination, and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms,
            legs, shoulders, back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. It is super fun and you can do cool flips and moves.</p>
